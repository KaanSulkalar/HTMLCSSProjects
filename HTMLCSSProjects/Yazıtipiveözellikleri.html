        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <b>If you are looking for the easiest way to begin trading, then you have come to the right place.
          I am going to explain what trading is and how you can begin trading to earn in the financial markets.
          Trading is risking money in hopes of earning more money from that investment at a future point in time.
          This is where skill and experience come into play because not many people know how to trade and make money doing it, so make sure you follow the advice about doing your own research.
          So if you are looking for an easy way to begin day trading, then this post will help you out greatly!
            You can put your first trade (or <a href="" >paper trade</a>)  out onto the market today!</b>
